🚀 Full-Stack Developer | React • Node.js • Laravel • React Native | AWS & DevOps Enthusiast

Hi, I’m Shivam Pawar — a software engineer passionate about building scalable web, mobile, and desktop applications that deliver measurable impact.

💻 Currently at ItsWorthMore.com, I design and develop cross-platform diagnostic and e-commerce systems using React, Laravel, Node.js, and React Native — improving productivity by 80% and cutting SaaS costs by $5K/month through smart architecture and automation.

🧩 Previously built a gamified coding app (Spot Fitness) with 150+ algorithmic challenges, optimized for performance (95+ Lighthouse score) and scalability.

🎓 As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UCF, I mentored 150+ students in OOP, data structures, and algorithms, helping bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world software engineering.

🛠️ Tech Stack: React, React Native, Node.js, Laravel, TypeScript, C++, Java, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, AWS (EC2, S3), Docker, CI/CD, Fastlane, Zustand, Figma

🌱 I love turning complex problems into elegant, maintainable code and continuously learning about cloud architecture, performance optimization, and modern app ecosystems.
